// Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

// Note: In case of multiple occurrences of floor of x, return the index of the last occurrence.

// Examples

// Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 5
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Largest number less than or equal to 5 is 2, whose index is 1.
// Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 11
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Largest Number less than or equal to 11 is 10, whose indices are 3 and 4. The index of last occurrence is 4.
// Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 0
// Output: -1
// Explanation: No element less than or equal to 0 is found. So, output is -1.
// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
// 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
// 0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]
